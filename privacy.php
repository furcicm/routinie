						<h1>Wesrom Online Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p>Wesrom attaches great importance to handling your data in a secure and private way.<br><br></p>
						<p>Personal data is saved, processed and analyzed only if necessary. Data will not be handed over to third parties other than for payment issues. Under no circumstances will we sell or lease your data. There may be times we use your data anonymously combined with other users data. For example: Over 500,000 people are actively using our platform!</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>To improve our service on an ongoing basis, we will evaluate some of the key figures of your account for statistical reasons. This includes the number of time entries, hours, routine and so on.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
						<p>When you sign up for an account, you will have to provide some personal information: Your name, password and your e-mail address. <br>
						</p>
						<p>If you contact Wesrom via e-mail or instant messaging, we will save a copy of the conversation for later reference. If you comment on our blog, we will save your IP address.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
						<p>Wesrom does not hand over personal information to third parties or use it in any non-related matter, as long as we do not have your written permission to do so (e.g. per e-mail) or are forced to do so by law.</p>
					</div>
              <div class="row">
				<h2>Cookies</h2>
				  <p>Wesrom uses cookies - small files containing a string of characters. We use cookies to improve the quality and usability of our service. Most of the cookies used by Wesrom are so-called session cookies: they will be deleted after your session automatically. Wesrom also uses cookies to identify a user during a session, so the user does not have to log in on any personalized site again and again.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p>You can force your browser to block cookies in your browser settings, but we do not recommend that because some features might not be usable anymore.</p>
				</div>
              <div class="row">
				<h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
					  <p>Your Wesrom platform account (e.g. a Routinie account) is password protected to prevent others from getting access to your data. We advise you to chose a secure password (more than six characters, including numbers) as well as to change your password periodically.</p>
					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <p>When using Wesrom over a public network, at internet cafes, or when you are sharing your computer with other people. Log out when you're done, and shut down the browser window to make sure others can not access your personal information.</p>
				  </div>
              <div class="row">
				<h2>Changes</h2>
					<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without telling you about it via e-mail, and we expect that most changes will be minor. You will find the current version right here.</p>
				</div>
              <div class="row">
				<h2>More Information</h2>
					  <p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions about the processing or storage of your data.</p>
